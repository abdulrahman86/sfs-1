The code in this directory implements a simple user-level SFS server.
It implements the NFS3 calls using the POSIX file system calls.  Since
the server doesn't know when the client closes a file, the main
implementation challenge is simulating close on the server---if server
doesn't the server will run out of file descriptors.

The server is supposed to run as a user-level process under the
priviledge of an ordinary user.  The server itself doesn't check
credentials and permissions.  Be careful what you export.

The code hasn't been extensively tested yet (in fact, it is under
development).  The server was able to run the andrew file system
benchmark multiple times without restarting the server between runs.

The configuration file for the server should contain two fields:
1. the pathname for a file containing the private key of the server
2. the directory exported.

An example configure file might contain the following two lines:

keyfile /home/ny2/kaashoek/src/sfs/build1/sfs_host_key
export /disk/ld0/kaashoek/tmp
